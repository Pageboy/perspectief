Our cruise downstream gave the crew a slight case of sunburn in spite of lashings of sunscreen. We were fortunate to be able to find good moorings for our nights but we have learnt to arrive early at the popular locations.

We observed an abundance of wildlife; herons, red kites and the usual swans, ducks, geese and grebe. Many of the swans and ducks have chicks.

The Oxford to Paddington mainline crosses the Thames at several places on our route from Oxford to Pangbourne.
