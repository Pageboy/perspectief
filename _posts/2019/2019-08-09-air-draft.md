On a very blustery day, we took friends Benno, Birgit and Maria for trip downstream to Nuneham. From Oxford to Nuneham was a popular excursion in Victorian times.

The title of this post requires an explanation. _Air Draft_ has nothing to do with the wind on this day, which did indeed make steering into locks a little bit risky. _Air Draft_ refers to the distance from the surface of the water to the highest point on the vessel. As you will have seen from the previous post, _Perspectief_ can navigate under Osney Bridge (headway 2.8metres) but only after removing the windscreen and the upper helm. All of the heights of the bridges on the Thames are specified on maps and guides and so, one can know if the bridges can be passed successfully.

**Folly Bridge** in Oxford has a headway of 3.12 metres and we can navigate this but the skipper needs to duck!
