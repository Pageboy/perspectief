Late April and we take the train to Wargrave for a trip upstream to Oxford. The mooring at Osney awaits!

Perspectief was put back in the water at the marina and we found the boat ready for departure. We carried with us some supplies.

Our first lock was Shiplake. Here the crew is holding on while we wait for the lock to open.

We needed supplies so the Tesco shop in Reading was a convenient place to stop.

Between Sandford and Iffley we moor up on the opposite bank to Rose Island.
